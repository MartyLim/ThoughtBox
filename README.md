# ThoughtBox

ThoughtBox is a minimalistic web application for taking notes quickly and easily with just a password. 

ThoughtBox was built with python, 
utilizing the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) web framework with the [SQLAlchemy](http://flask-sqlalchemy.pocoo.org/2.3/) extension for the database and [bcrypt](https://flask-bcrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for password encryption, 
and HTML, 
using the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library and [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) templating.
